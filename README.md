Hi my name is Sarah Ford and I am a senior Computer Science and International Studies major at the College of Charleston.  I am passionate about reasearching and learning and I love computer science because it allows me to work in all different sorts of disciplines. I love to solve problems both big and small through techonology. Ultimately, I want to make a difference with my skills in coding and analytical way of thinking and I hope you will consider me for your position if your company has similar aspirations to make a difference in the world. 

In this repository, you'll find a sampling of some my work in my Java and C courses. My experience is much broader than this collection (see my other repositories).
